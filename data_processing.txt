KC_house data (looking at the data)

- First thing I got rid of was the ID attribute because this seemed to be like an sql database ID

- I then saw that the date was an object instead of an integer or float and it wasn't significant when looking at correlation with price
    so I dropped that attribute as well
- When looking at pandas scatter matrix plot for the attributes price, sqft_living, grade, sft_above, and sqft_living15
    I noticed there could be some possible outliers that we could cut out on the price(y) and sqft_living(x) graph for the far right.
    I also noticed some with sqft_above(y) and sqft_living(x) there is a strange slopped threshold in the data that might cause problems when predicting.

- Right now sqft_living has the most positive correlation with the price attribute with ~70%
